the generalization performance or error-
However, error rates hide a lot of interesting information that is very important for an interpretation of results

prediction error

>> Looking here and there -- Searchlights

implement a classification analysis
our signal of interest is located
confusion matrices
estimating a score for each feature
compute an ANOVA F-score per each feature

> Measures

is relatively painless
If the code snippet above
Where have we seen this before
CrossValidation returns a dataset with a single feature -- the accuracy or error rate
while OneWayAnova returns a vector with one value per feature
But other than the number
